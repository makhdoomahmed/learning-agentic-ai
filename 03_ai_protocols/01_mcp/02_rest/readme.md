# REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST, or **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer, is a **software architectural style** for designing networked applications, particularly web services. 

It was first defined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation, drawing upon the principles that guided the architecture of the World Wide Web. 

REST is not a protocol or a specific technology but rather a set of constraints that, when applied, lead to scalable, stateless, and reliable systems. The core idea is that clients interact with _representations_ of _resources_ managed by servers.

---

## Core Architectural Constraints of REST

REST is defined by six guiding architectural constraints. Adherence to these constraints aims to produce systems with desirable non-functional properties like performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

1.  **Client-Server Architecture**:

    - Assumes a separation between the client (which handles user interface concerns) and the server (which handles data storage, business logic, and security).
    - This separation allows client and server components to evolve independently, as long as the interface between them remains consistent.

2.  **Statelessness**:

    - Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed for the server to understand and process the request.
    - The server does not store any client context (session state) between requests. Any session state is kept on the client side.
    - Benefits: Improves scalability (any server can handle any request), reliability (easier to recover from failures), and visibility (monitoring is simpler as each request is self-contained).

3.  **Cacheability**:

    - Responses from the server must explicitly define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
    - If a response is cacheable, a client (or an intermediary cache like a CDN) can reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.
    - Benefits: Reduces latency, improves network efficiency, and decreases server load.

4.  **Layered System**:

    - REST allows for an architecture composed of hierarchical layers. Components in one layer can only interact with components in adjacent layers.
    - A client typically cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary (e.g., load balancer, proxy, API gateway) along the way.
    - Benefits: Enhances scalability by enabling load balancing and shared caches. Enforces security policies at different layers.

5.  **Code on Demand (Optional)**:

    - Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (e.g., JavaScript applets or scripts).
    - This is the only optional constraint in REST. While powerful, it can reduce visibility and is less commonly emphasized in modern REST API design compared to data exchange.

6.  **Uniform Interface**:
    - This is a key principle that distinguishes REST from other architectural styles. It simplifies and decouples the architecture, enabling each part to evolve independently. The uniform interface is defined by four sub-constraints:
      1.  **Identification of Resources**: Individual resources (e.g., a user profile, a product, a collection of articles) are uniquely identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically URLs.
      2.  **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations**: Clients interact with resources by exchanging _representations_ of those resources. A representation is a snapshot of the resource's state at a particular time, commonly in formats like JSON or XML. The representation (along with metadata) should be sufficient for the client to modify or delete the resource on the server.
      3.  **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each message (request or response) exchanged between client and server must contain enough information for the recipient to understand how to process it. This includes:
          - The resource URI.
          - The HTTP method (verb) indicating the desired action.
          - Metadata in headers (e.g., `Content-Type` specifying the media type of the payload, `Accept` specifying desired response media types).
          - The payload itself (for requests like POST/PUT, or for responses).
      4.  **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: This is arguably the most mature and often least implemented aspect of REST. Clients should be able to discover possible actions and navigate an application's resources by following hyperlinks provided dynamically in server responses. The client doesn't need prior knowledge of all resource URIs; it starts with an initial URI and discovers others through these server-provided links. This allows the server to evolve its URI space and available actions without breaking clients.

## Key Concepts in RESTful APIs

When discussing RESTful APIs (APIs that adhere to REST principles), several concepts are central:

- **Resources**: The fundamental concept in REST. A resource is any information or entity that can be named and addressed. Examples: a document, an image, a user, a service, a collection of other resources. Resources are identified by URIs.
- **Representations**: When a client requests a resource, the server sends back a representation of that resource's state. This is commonly in JSON or XML format, but could also be HTML, plain text, images, etc. The same resource can have multiple representations (e.g., a user resource represented as JSON or XML).
- **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**: Standard HTTP methods are used to perform operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD) on resources:
  - `GET`: Retrieve a representation of a resource or a collection of resources.
  - `POST`: Create a new resource. Often used for actions that don't fit neatly into CRUD operations on a specific resource.
  - `PUT`: Replace an existing resource entirely with a new representation. If the resource doesn't exist, it may create it.
  - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.
  - `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource.
  - `OPTIONS`: Get information about the communication options for the target resource (e.g., allowed HTTP methods).
  - `HEAD`: Retrieve only the headers of a resource, not the body (identical to GET but without the response body).
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Standardized codes used in responses to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Examples:
  - `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
  - `201 Created`: Resource successfully created (often in response to POST or PUT).
  - `204 No Content`: Request succeeded, but there is no content to return (e.g., for a successful DELETE).
  - `400 Bad Request`: Server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
  - `403 Forbidden`: Server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it (client does not have permission).
  - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  - `500 Internal ServerError`: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered on the server.
- **Idempotence**: An operation is idempotent if making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. In HTTP:
  - `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `DELETE` are typically idempotent.
  - `POST` is generally not idempotent (e.g., multiple POSTs usually create multiple resources).
  - `PATCH` can be idempotent if implemented carefully (e.g., using conditional requests).
- **Media Types**: Specify the format of the representation (e.g., `application/json`, `application/xml`, `text/html`, `image/jpeg`). Communicated via `Content-Type` (for request/response bodies) and `Accept` (for client-desired response formats) headers.

## Designing a RESTful API - Best Practices

While REST is an architectural style, several best practices have emerged for designing practical and user-friendly RESTful HTTP APIs:

1.  **Use Nouns for Resource URIs**: URIs should identify resources, not actions. Use plural nouns for collections.
    - Good: `/users`, `/users/{userId}`, `/orders`, `/products/{productId}/reviews`
    - Avoid: `/getAllUsers`, `/createNewUser`, `/products/delete/{productId}`
2.  **Use HTTP Methods Correctly**: Map CRUD operations to HTTP methods appropriately (GET for read, POST for create, PUT for replace, PATCH for partial update, DELETE for remove).
3.  **Provide Meaningful HTTP Status Codes**: Use standard status codes to indicate the outcome of requests accurately.
4.  **Support Common Data Formats**: JSON (`application/json`) is the most common format for modern REST APIs. XML (`application/xml`) is also used.
5.  **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: For collections, provide mechanisms for clients to filter results, sort them, and paginate through large datasets (e.g., using query parameters like `/users?status=active&sort=lastName&offset=0&limit=20`).
6.  **Versioning**: Plan for API evolution. Common strategies include:
    - URI Path Versioning: `/v1/users`, `/v2/users` (most common and straightforward).
    - Query Parameter Versioning: `/users?version=1`.
    - Custom Header Versioning: `X-API-Version: 1`.
    - Media Type Versioning (Content Negotiation): `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`.
7.  **Clear Error Handling**: Provide informative error messages in the response body (typically JSON) when an error status code is returned. Include details like an error code, a human-readable message, and potentially links to documentation.
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
        "message": "The 'email' field is required and must be a valid email address.",
        "details_url": "https://api.example.com/docs/errors#INVALID_INPUT"
      }
    }
    ```
8.  **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization.
    - **Authentication** (verifying identity): API Keys, OAuth 2.0 (Bearer Tokens), JWTs.
    - **Authorization** (verifying permissions): Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), scopes (with OAuth 2.0).
    - Always use HTTPS (TLS encryption) for all API communication.
9.  **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive, accurate, and easy-to-understand API documentation. Tools like **OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)** are widely used to define and document REST APIs.
10. **HATEOAS (Optional but Recommended for Maturity)**: Include links in responses to guide clients to related resources and available actions, promoting discoverability.

## Practical Example: Raw RESTful API Request and Response Messages

This example illustrates the raw text format of HTTP requests and responses for a RESTful API, showcasing how REST principles—such as resource identification, statelessness, and the use of standard HTTP methods—are applied in practice. The messages demonstrate interactions with a hypothetical RESTful API for managing "users" resources, aligning with the "Core Architectural Constraints of REST" and "Key Concepts in RESTful APIs" sections of the tutorial. 

## Example Overview
This section includes four raw HTTP messages that adhere to REST principles:
- A `GET` request to retrieve a representation of a specific user resource (`/users/123`).
- The server's `GET` response with a JSON representation of the user.
- A `POST` request to create a new user resource (`/users`).
- The server's `POST` response confirming the creation with a JSON representation of the new user.

These messages simulate interactions with a hypothetical RESTful API at `api.example.com` using HTTP/1.1. The explanations highlight REST-specific concepts, such as resource URIs, representations, self-descriptive messages, and the optional inclusion of HATEOAS links to demonstrate discoverability.


## Raw RESTful API Messages and Their Components

Below are the raw HTTP messages, each followed by an explanation of its components, focusing on how they embody REST principles. The messages are formatted exactly as they would appear in a network transaction, with proper line breaks and spacing.

### 1. GET Request
```
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Accept: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Explanation**:
- **REST Principles Demonstrated**:
  - **Identification of Resources**: The URI `/users/123` uniquely identifies a specific user resource, following the REST convention of using nouns to represent resources.
  - **Statelessness**: The request contains all necessary information (URI, headers, authentication token) for the server to process it without relying on stored client context.
  - **Uniform Interface**: Uses the `GET` method to retrieve a representation of the resource, with the `Accept` header specifying the desired format (`application/json`).
- **Message Components**:
  - **Start-Line**: `GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1`
    - **Method**: `GET` – Requests a representation of the user resource.
    - **URI**: `/users/123` – Identifies the specific user with ID 123.
    - **HTTP Version**: `HTTP/1.1`.
  - **Headers**:
    - `Host: api.example.com` – Specifies the API domain.
    - `Accept: application/json` – Requests a JSON representation of the resource.
    - `User-Agent` – Identifies the client (e.g., a browser or custom client).
    - `Accept-Language` – Indicates preferred languages for the response.
    - `Connection: keep-alive` – Requests the server to maintain the TCP connection.
    - `Authorization` – Includes a Bearer token for authentication, ensuring secure access to the resource.
  - **Empty Line**: Separates headers from the body (CRLF).
  - **Body**: None – `GET` requests in REST typically have no body, as they retrieve data.

### 2. GET Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 12 Jun 2025 09:19:00 GMT
Server: Nginx/1.18.0
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 165
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "_links": {
    "self": {"href": "/users/123"},
    "update": {"href": "/users/123", "method": "PATCH"},
    "delete": {"href": "/users/123", "method": "DELETE"}
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **REST Principles Demonstrated**:
  - **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations**: The response provides a JSON representation of the user resource's state, including attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email`.
  - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: The `Content-Type` header specifies the representation format (`application/json`), and the body includes all necessary data.
  - **HATEOAS**: The `_links` object provides hyperlinks to related actions (`self`, `update`, `delete`), enabling clients to discover possible next steps dynamically.
  - **Cacheability**: The `Cache-Control` header (`max-age=3600`) indicates the response can be cached for one hour, reducing server load for subsequent requests.
- **Message Components**:
  - **Start-Line**: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
    - **HTTP Version**: `HTTP/1.1`.
    - **Status Code**: `200` – Indicates the request was successful.
    - **Reason Phrase**: `OK`.
  - **Headers**:
    - `Date` – Timestamp of the response.
    - `Server` – Identifies the server software (Nginx).
    - `Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8` – Specifies the JSON format and UTF-8 encoding.
    - `Content-Length: 165` – Length of the JSON body in bytes.
    - `Cache-Control` – Enables caching for 3600 seconds.
    - `Connection: keep-alive` – Allows connection reuse.
  - **Empty Line**: Separates headers from the body.
  - **Body**: A JSON object representing the user, with HATEOAS links for discoverability.

### 3. POST Request
```
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 65
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

{
  "name": "Bob Johnson",
  "email": "bob@example.com"
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **REST Principles Demonstrated**:
  - **Identification of Resources**: The URI `/users` identifies the collection resource for users, where a new user will be created.
  - **Statelessness**: The request includes all data (JSON payload, authentication token) needed to create the resource, without server-side session state.
  - **Uniform Interface**: Uses the `POST` method to create a new resource, with `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers specifying JSON for the request and response.
  - **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations**: The JSON body provides the representation of the new user to be created.
- **Message Components**:
  - **Start-Line**: `POST /users HTTP/1.1`
    - **Method**: `POST` – Creates a new resource in the users collection.
    - **URI**: `/users` – Targets the users collection.
    - **HTTP Version**: `HTTP/1.1`.
  - **Headers**:
    - `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Connection`, `Authorization` – Similar to the GET request.
    - `Accept: application/json` – Requests a JSON response.
    - `Content-Type: application/json` – Indicates the request body is JSON.
    - `Content-Length: 65` – Length of the JSON body in bytes.
  - **Empty Line**: Separates headers from the body.
  - **Body**: A JSON object with `name` and `email` fields for the new user.

### 4. POST Response
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Thu, 12 Jun 2025 09:19:05 GMT
Server: Nginx/1.18.0
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 188
Location: /users/124
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "id": 124,
  "name": "Bob Johnson",
  "email": "bob@example.com",
  "_links": {
    "self": {"href": "/users/124"},
    "update": {"href": "/users/124", "method": "PATCH"},
    "delete": {"href": "/users/124", "method": "DELETE"}
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **REST Principles Demonstrated**:
  - **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations**: The response returns a JSON representation of the newly created user, including the server-assigned `id`.
  - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: The `Content-Type` and `Location` headers provide metadata about the response and the new resource's URI.
  - **HATEOAS**: The `_links` object includes hyperlinks for further actions, supporting dynamic navigation.
  - **Uniform Interface**: The `201 Created` status code and `Location` header indicate successful resource creation and provide the URI of the new resource.
- **Message Components**:
  - **Start-Line**: `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`
    - **HTTP Version**: `HTTP/1.1`.
    - **Status Code**: `201` – Indicates the resource was created successfully.
    - **Reason Phrase**: `Created`.
  - **Headers**:
    - `Date`, `Server`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Connection` – Similar to the GET response.
    - `Location: /users/124` – Specifies the URI of the newly created user resource.
  - **Empty Line**: Separates headers from the body.
  - **Body**: A JSON object representing the new user, with HATEOAS links.

## Key REST Concepts Demonstrated
This example ties directly to the "Core Architectural Constraints of REST" and "Key Concepts in RESTful APIs" sections by illustrating:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The requests and responses separate client concerns (sending requests) from server concerns (processing and storing resources).
- **Statelessness**: Each request is self-contained, with authentication tokens and data included, requiring no server-side session state.
- **Cacheability**: The GET response includes a `Cache-Control` header to enable caching, reducing server load.
- **Uniform Interface**:
  - **Identification of Resources**: URIs like `/users/123` and `/users` clearly identify resources.
  - **Manipulation Through Representations**: JSON payloads represent resource states for creation and retrieval.
  - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Headers like `Content-Type`, `Accept`, and `Authorization` make messages interpretable.
  - **HATEOAS**: Response links enable clients to discover related resources and actions dynamically.
- **HTTP Methods**: `GET` retrieves a resource representation; `POST` creates a new resource.
- **HTTP Status Codes**: `200 OK` for successful retrieval, `201 Created` for successful creation with a `Location` header.
- **Media Types**: `application/json` is used consistently for representations, as specified in headers.

## Working with REST APIs in Python

Python offers excellent libraries for both consuming (client-side) and building (server-side) REST APIs.

### Client-Side: `requests` Library

The `requests` library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python.

**Installation**:

```bash
uv init rest_code
cd rest_code
# Install requests
uv add requests
```

**Example: Consuming a Public REST API**

```python
import requests
import json

# Using JSONPlaceholder, a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.
BASE_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"

# --- GET request to fetch a single post ---
def get_post(post_id):
    print(f"\\n--- GET Request for post/{post_id} ---")
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/posts/{post_id}")
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses (4XX or 5XX)

        print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        post_data = response.json()
        print(f"Post Title: {post_data.get('title')}")
        # print(f"Full Response Data: {post_data}")
        return post_data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f"  Http Error: {errh}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f"  Error Connecting: {errc}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f"  Timeout Error: {errt}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"  Something Else Went Wrong: {err}")
    return None

# --- POST request to create a new post ---
def create_post(title, body, user_id):
    print("\\n--- POST Request to /posts ---")
    new_post_payload = {
        "title": title,
        "body": body,
        "userId": user_id
    }
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"}
    try:
        response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/posts", data=json.dumps(new_post_payload), headers=headers, timeout=5)
        response.raise_for_status()

        print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") # Should be 201 Created
        created_post_data = response.json()
        print(f"Created Post ID: {created_post_data.get('id')}")
        print(f"Created Post Title: {created_post_data.get('title')}")
        return created_post_data
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"  POST request failed: {e}")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_post(1)
    get_post(9999) # Example of a resource not found (should trigger 404)

    created_post = create_post("My New Post", "This is the body of my amazing new post.", 101)
    if created_post:
        print(f"Successfully created post with ID: {created_post.get('id')}")

```

## REST vs. Other Architectural Styles/Protocols

- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
  - SOAP is a protocol with a rigid specification, typically using XML for message formats and often relying on WSDL for service description.
  - REST is an architectural style with more flexibility, commonly using JSON over HTTP, and can leverage standards like OpenAPI for description.
  - SOAP can be more complex and verbose but offers built-in standards for security (WS-Security) and transactions, often favored in enterprise environments.
- **GraphQL**:
  - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing those queries.
  - Clients request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching common with traditional REST APIs that return fixed data structures for resources.
  - GraphQL typically uses a single endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`) and HTTP POST for all operations.
  - REST uses multiple endpoints (URIs) and HTTP verbs to define operations on resources.
  - They can coexist; some systems use GraphQL for flexible data fetching and REST for simpler resource manipulation or command-like operations.
- **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**:
  - gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that can run in any environment. It typically uses Protocol Buffers for defining service contracts and message formats, and HTTP/2 as its transport protocol.
  - Focuses on efficiency, low latency, and strong typing. Excellent for microservice communication.
  - REST is more focused on resource-oriented architecture and leverages standard HTTP semantics, making it broadly accessible.

---

## Strengths of REST

- **Simplicity and Ease of Understanding**: Based on familiar HTTP methods and URIs, making it relatively easy to learn and use.
- **Scalability**: Statelessness and cacheability contribute significantly to the ability to scale horizontally.
- **Interoperability and Wide Adoption**: Platform and language-agnostic. Supported by virtually all programming languages and web frameworks.
- **Flexibility in Data Formats**: While JSON is most common, REST can use XML, HTML, plain text, or any other format.
- **Leverages Existing Web Infrastructure**: Utilizes standard HTTP, URIs, DNS, and caching mechanisms.
- **Discoverability (with HATEOAS)**: Well-implemented HATEOAS allows clients to dynamically navigate APIs.

---

## Weaknesses/Limitations of REST

- **Over-fetching and Under-fetching**: Fixed resource representations can lead to clients receiving more data than they need (over-fetching) or needing to make multiple requests to get all required data (under-fetching). GraphQL specifically addresses this.
- **Multiple Round Trips**: Complex data needs might require several client-server round trips to fetch related resources, increasing latency.
- **Statelessness Overhead**: Since each request must be self-contained, it might carry redundant information (e.g., authentication tokens in every request).
- **No Built-in Real-time/Push Capabilities**: REST is primarily client-initiated (pull-based). For server-initiated updates or real-time bidirectional communication, technologies like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) are generally preferred.
- **Standardization can be Loose**: Being an architectural style, interpretations of REST can vary, leading to inconsistencies across different APIs if design principles are not strictly followed.
- **Managing Many Endpoints**: For very complex systems with many resources and operations, the number of distinct endpoints can become large.

## Use Cases in Agentic AI Systems (DACA Context)

RESTful APIs are a cornerstone for building modular and interoperable agentic AI systems like those envisioned by the DACA pattern:

- **Core Agent Functionality API**: Exposing an agent's capabilities, status, and configuration via REST endpoints.
  - `GET /agents/{agent_id}/status`
  - `POST /agents/{agent_id}/tasks` (to assign a new task)
  - `GET /agents/{agent_id}/tasks/{task_id}`
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can interact with external tools, services, or data sources that expose REST APIs (e.g., weather APIs, knowledge bases, search engines).
- **Data Exchange and Persistence**: Agents can retrieve data from or store data to databases, vector stores, or other storage services through RESTful interfaces.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: For simpler, request-response style communication between agents, REST can be a straightforward choice, especially if agents are developed as independent microservices.
- **Management and Orchestration APIs**: The DACA infrastructure itself (e.g., for deploying, monitoring, scaling, and configuring agents) can be managed via REST APIs.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interfaces**: Web-based dashboards or control panels for human oversight and intervention would typically interact with the backend agent systems via REST APIs.
- **Model Serving**: While specialized model serving solutions exist (like TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe), simpler models or custom inference logic can be exposed as REST endpoints.
  - `POST /models/{model_id}/predict`
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Agents can send logs or metrics to a central logging/monitoring service via REST.

In DACA, REST APIs provide a standardized, well-understood way to ensure that different components of the agentic system (agents, tools, data stores, UIs) can communicate effectively and be developed/scaled independently.
