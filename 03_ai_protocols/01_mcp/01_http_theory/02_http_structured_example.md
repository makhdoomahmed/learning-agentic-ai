# ‚úÖ What is `curl`?

* `curl` is a command-line tool that lets you send **HTTP requests** and see the **responses**.
* Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with Git Bash or WSL).

## Let's pretend we‚Äôre interacting with a simple test server:

We'll use [https://reqres.in](https://reqres.in), a **fake REST API** made for testing HTTP requests.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **GET** ‚Äì Retrieve data

Get the list of users:

```bash
curl https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2
```

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôll get a response like:

```json
{
  "page": 2,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 7,
      "email": "michael.lawson@reqres.in",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ This is just like opening a webpage and reading its content.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **POST** ‚Äì Send data (e.g., signup)

Create a new user:

```bash
curl -X POST https://reqres.in/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Wania", "job": "Developer"}'
```

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôll get a response like:

```json
{
  "name": "Wania",
  "job": "Developer",
  "id": "245",
  "createdAt": "2025-06-17T22:00:00.000Z"
}
```

‚úÖ This simulates submitting a form to create a new account.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **PUT** ‚Äì Update (replace) data

Update the user completely:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://reqres.in/api/users/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Wania", "job": "Senior Dev"}'
```

‚û°Ô∏è Response:

```json
{
  "name": "Wania",
  "job": "Senior Dev",
  "updatedAt": "2025-06-17T22:05:00.000Z"
}
```

‚úÖ This replaces the old job with "Senior Dev".

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **PATCH** ‚Äì Partially update data

Update only one field (e.g., just the job):

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://reqres.in/api/users/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "Engineer"}'
```

‚û°Ô∏è Response:

```json
{
  "job": "Engineer",
  "updatedAt": "2025-06-17T22:10:00.000Z"
}
```

‚úÖ This changes only the job, not the name.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **DELETE** ‚Äì Remove a resource

Delete a user:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://reqres.in/api/users/2
```

‚û°Ô∏è Response: *(no body, just status `204 No Content`)*

‚úÖ This tells the client that the user was deleted successfully.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **HEAD** ‚Äì Get only headers (no content)

```bash
curl -I https://reqres.in/api/users/2
```

‚û°Ô∏è You get:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 123
...
```

‚úÖ Used when you want to check metadata without downloading the whole page/data.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **OPTIONS** ‚Äì Ask what methods are allowed

```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://reqres.in/api/users/2 -i
```

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôll get:

```
Allow: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
```

‚úÖ This tells the browser or client what‚Äôs allowed on this endpoint.
