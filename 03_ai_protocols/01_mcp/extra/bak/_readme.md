# Foundational Protocols for Agentic and Multi-Modal AI Systems

This module provides a future-proofed, pedagogically ordered learning path through the foundational protocols that underpin modern, scalable, and multi-modal agentic AI systems. Each protocol is presented in a sequence that builds conceptual understanding from the network layer up to advanced real-time and multi-modal communication, serialization, and emerging research.

## Prerequisites

- 01 AI Agents First Module
- Modern Python ([including Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html))

## Why This Structure?

- **Agentic AI systems** require robust, interoperable, and efficient communication at every layer.
- **Multi-modal agents** (processing text, audio, video, sensor data, etc.) need protocols that support diverse, high-throughput, and low-latency data flows.
- **Future-proofing**: The field is evolving rapidly. This structure is designed to be extensible, with a dedicated section for emerging and experimental protocols.
