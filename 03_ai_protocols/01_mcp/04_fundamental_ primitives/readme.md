# Module 4: MCP Fundamental Primitives

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication layer for Agents context and tools so you don't have to write a bunch of tedious integration code for each project. Use it to shift the burden of tool definitions and execution away from your server to MCP servers.

- If Github have MCP server and my agent have to manage some GitHub Actions why write them again?
- Like companies providing APIs now they will likely create MCP implementation.
- It's Transport agnostic with some caveats- the client and server can communicate over different protocols.

> **Master the core building blocks of Model Context Protocol through hands-on coding**  
> Based on [Anthropic's Introduction to Model Context Protocol Course](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/introduction-to-model-context-protocol)

## Overview

This module introduces the three fundamental primitives of MCP: **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts**. You'll learn to build MCP servers and clients using the Python SDK, focusing on practical, code-driven examples that demonstrate real-world applications.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

### Core Competencies
- ‚úÖ **Build MCP servers** using the Python SDK with decorator-based tool definitions
- ‚úÖ **Implement all three MCP primitives**: Tools (model-controlled), Resources (app-controlled), Prompts (user-controlled)
- ‚úÖ **Create MCP clients** that connect to and interact with servers
- ‚úÖ **Use the MCP Server Inspector** for testing and debugging server functionality

### Technical Skills
- ‚úÖ **Define tools with decorators** instead of writing JSON schemas manually
- ‚úÖ **Implement file management functionality** with tools for reading, writing, and managing files
- ‚úÖ **Create resources** for exposing read-only data with proper MIME type handling
- ‚úÖ **Build prompts** that provide pre-crafted instructions for common workflows
- ‚úÖ **Handle errors gracefully** with proper exception handling and user feedback

### Understanding
- ‚úÖ **Distinguish between MCP primitives**: Know when to use tools vs. resources vs. prompts
- ‚úÖ **Understand control models**: Model-controlled (tools), app-controlled (resources), user-controlled (prompts)
- ‚úÖ **Apply best practices** for security, performance, and maintainability

## Prerequisites

- Working knowledge of Python programming
- Basic understanding of JSON and HTTP request-response patterns
- Familiarity with decorators and type hints in Python

## Learning Structure

### 1. Project Setup and First Server
**Goal**: Establish development environment and create your first working MCP server

- [01_hello_mcp_server](./01_hello_mcp_server/read.md) - Setting up your development environment with `uv` using base_project
- [02_project_setup](./02_project_setup/readme.md) - Set your Base Project for this learning module

### 2. Building Tools and Resources
**Goal**: Master the three fundamental MCP primitives through practical examples

- [03_defining_tools](./03_defining_tools/readme.md) - Creating tools with decorators and type hints
- [04_implementing_client](./04_implementing_client/readme.md) - For mcp tools create a simple client.
- [05_defining_resources.md](05_defining_resources.md) - Creating read-only data resources
- [06. Working with Prompts](06_working_with_prompts.md) - Building pre-crafted prompts for common workflows

## MCP Core Primitives

### 1. Tools (Model-Controlled)
Tools are functions that AI models can call to perform actions. They are:
- **Model-controlled**: The AI decides when and how to use them
- **Action-oriented**: Perform specific tasks like reading files, making API calls
- **Decorator-based**: Defined using Python decorators with type hints

### 2. Resources (App-Controlled)
Resources provide read-only access to data. They are:
- **App-controlled**: The application decides when to expose them
- **Data-focused**: Provide access to documents, databases, APIs
- **URI-based**: Accessed through specific URIs with optional parameters

### 3. Prompts (User-Controlled)
Prompts are pre-crafted instructions for common workflows. They are:
- **User-controlled**: Users decide when to apply them
- **Instruction-focused**: Provide high-quality, reusable prompts
- **Context-aware**: Can include dynamic content and formatting

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**: Follow the [project setup guide](01_project_setup.md)
2. **Create First Server**: Build a simple MCP server with tools
3. **Test with Inspector**: Use the built-in server inspector for debugging
4. **Add Resources**: Implement read-only data access
5. **Build Client**: Create an MCP client to connect with your server
6. **Create Prompts**: Build reusable prompt templates

### Knowledge Check
- [ ] Can explain the difference between tools, resources, and prompts
- [ ] Understand when to use each MCP primitive
- [ ] Can implement proper error handling in MCP servers
- [ ] Know how to use the MCP Server Inspector effectively
- [ ] Can create both static and templated resources
- [ ] Understand MIME type handling for different content types

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

- **`uv`**: Fast Python package manager for dependency management
- **MCP Python SDK**: Core library for building MCP servers and clients
- **MCP Server Inspector**: Web-based tool for testing and debugging servers
- **Postman**: Test APIs

### Recommended Tools
- **Cursor or VS Code**: IDE with Python and MCP extensions
