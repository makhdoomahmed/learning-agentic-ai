# OAuth 2.1 and Security for MCP

**Objective:** Implement the complete, end-to-end OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code Flow as specified by the MCP `2025-06-18` standard.

This section is the cornerstone of building secure, production-ready MCP applications. We will create a secure MCP Resource Server and a compliant MCP Client that knows how to acquire and use access tokens to interact with protected resources.

This is a deep, multi-step journey that covers the full lifecycle of modern API security.

## Key MCP and OAuth Concepts

-   **MCP as an OAuth Resource Server:** An MCP server is not just a tool provider; it's a protected resource. We will configure our MCP server to require a valid access token for all its operations.
-   **Authorization Server (AS):** A separate, third-party service responsible for authenticating users and issuing access tokens. We will create a simple OAuth AS for demonstration.
-   **Two-Stage Discovery Process:** 
    1. **Protected Resource Metadata** (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` on MCP server) - tells clients where to find the Authorization Server
    2. **Authorization Server Metadata** (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` on AS) - tells clients the specific endpoints for registration, authorization, and tokens
-   **Dynamic Client Registration:** How a client can programmatically register itself with an Authorization Server.
-   **Authorization Code Flow:** The secure, browser-based flow where a user grants consent, and the client receives an authorization code, which it then exchanges for an access token.
-   **Resource Indicators (RFC 8707):** A critical security feature where the client specifies the intended audience (the MCP server) for the requested token, preventing token leakage and misuse.
-   **Token Validation (JWT):** The MCP server's responsibility to receive an access token (as a JWT), validate its signature, issuer, and audience, and extract user claims before granting access.

## Learning Path

We build the entire flow from the ground up, piece by piece. **Each step provides TWO implementations:**

### üìö **Custom Implementation** (Educational)
Simple, focused Python code (~30-100 lines) that teaches core concepts without external dependencies.

### üè≠ **Open Source Implementation** (Production)  
Real-world examples using established OAuth libraries and servers for production deployment.

---

1.  **`01_protected_resource_metadata`:** MCP server advertises its security requirements and Authorization Server location via `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` - implements the first stage of OAuth discovery

2.  **`02_authorization_server_metadata`:** Create a simple OAuth Authorization Server that provides its endpoint information via `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` - completes the two-stage discovery process
    - **Custom**: Basic Python HTTP server serving static metadata
    - **Open Source**: Keycloak setup + configuration or Hydra deployment

3.  **`03_dynamic_client_registration`:** Programmatically register our client with the Authorization Server using the `/register` endpoint - enables automatic client onboarding
    - **Custom**: Simple registration endpoint with in-memory storage
    - **Open Source**: Keycloak Dynamic Client Registration or Auth0 Management API

4.  **`04_oauth2_authorization_code_flow`:** Implement the full, user-facing login flow to get an access token - the primary OAuth flow for user authentication
    - **Custom**: Mock HTML login form + code exchange
    - **Open Source**: GitHub OAuth integration or Google OAuth setup

5.  **`05_token_audience_validation`:** Implement JWT validation on the MCP server - ensures tokens are properly validated and scoped
    - **Custom**: PyJWT validation with hardcoded keys
    - **Open Source**: Using python-jose with JWKS endpoint discovery

6.  **`06_error_handling`:** Handle common OAuth errors like invalid tokens or insufficient scope - builds robust error handling
    - **Custom**: Basic error responses and client retry logic
    - **Open Source**: Authlib's built-in error handling patterns

7.  **`07_security_best_practices`:** Review and implement key security considerations from the spec - hardens the implementation
    - **Custom**: Security checklist and basic hardening
    - **Open Source**: Production Keycloak + NGINX setup with TLS

8.  **`08_client_credentials_flow`:** System-to-system authentication without user interaction - enables machine-to-machine communication for DACA agents
    - **Custom**: Direct client credentials exchange
    - **Open Source**: Service account setup in Auth0/Keycloak

## Current Step Breakdown

**Steps 1-3: Discovery & Registration (Foundation)**
- **01**: Find where the Auth Server is (`http://localhost:9000`)
- **02**: Query Auth Server to learn its endpoints (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`)  
- **03**: Register client to get `client_id` and `client_secret`

**Steps 4-7: Full OAuth Flow (User Interactive)**
- **04**: Complete authorization code flow (user login, get access token)
- **05**: MCP server validates tokens (JWT signature, audience, etc.)
- **06**: Handle OAuth errors (expired tokens, insufficient scope)
- **07**: Security best practices review

**Step 8: Alternative Flow (System-to-System)**
- **08**: Client credentials flow (no user interaction needed)

## The Logic Flow

For **human users** (interactive):
```
Steps 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5 = Complete user-interactive OAuth flow
```

For **system-to-system** (automated):
```
Steps 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí8‚Üí5 = Complete machine-to-machine flow
```

Steps 6-7 apply to both scenarios.

## What Happens in Later Steps?

After completing all OAuth steps, you'd typically move to:

1. **Build Real MCP Applications** - Use the secured MCP server for actual tools
2. **Deploy to Production** - Take the OAuth-secured setup to cloud platforms
3. **Scale with DACA** - Apply the Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent patterns we discussed
4. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Use the OAuth foundation for secure A2A protocols

## The Value of This Progression

Each step teaches a specific piece:
- **01-03**: How clients discover and register with auth systems
- **04**: How users authenticate and authorize
- **05**: How servers validate security
- **06-07**: How to handle real-world issues
- **08**: How systems authenticate without humans

This gives you the complete toolkit for both user-facing and automated secure MCP applications.

## DACA Alignment: Custom vs Open Source

This dual approach perfectly aligns with the **Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA)** deployment stages:

### üî¨ **Local Development & Learning** (Custom Implementations)
- **Stage**: Local development (step 1 of DACA ascent)
- **Purpose**: Understanding OAuth fundamentals without complexity
- **Tools**: Pure Python, minimal dependencies
- **Cost**: Free - no external services required
- **Scale**: 1-10 requests/second for learning

### üöÄ **Production & Enterprise** (Open Source Implementations)  
- **Stage**: Enterprise to Planet-scale (steps 3-4 of DACA ascent)
- **Purpose**: Battle-tested, feature-complete OAuth servers
- **Tools**: Keycloak, Auth0, GitHub OAuth, etc.
- **Cost**: Free tiers available, scales with usage
- **Scale**: Thousands to millions of concurrent agents

## Implementation Strategy

**For Learning**: Start with custom implementations to understand concepts
**For Production**: Migrate to open source solutions for reliability and scale
**For DACA**: Use client credentials flow (step 8) for agent-to-agent communication

## Two-Server Architecture

Step 01 and 02 implementation follows the MCP specification's two-server model:

- **MCP Server** (localhost:8000) - The Resource Server protecting tools/resources
- **Authorization Server** (localhost:9000) - The OAuth server handling authentication and token issuance

Each server has its own discovery endpoint:
- MCP Server: `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` 
- Authorization Server: `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

This separation allows for flexible deployment where the Authorization Server can serve multiple MCP servers.
